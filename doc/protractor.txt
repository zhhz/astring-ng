1. start only a suite
  $ðŸ’°  protractor test/config/protractor.conf.js --suite working

2. Testing Out Protractor Interactively
  ************************************************
  NOTE: ***DO NOT load the dev tools on Chrome****, interactive won't work
  ************************************************

  When debugging or first writing test suites, you may find it helpful to try out
    Protractor commands without starting up the entire test suite. You can do this with the element explorer.

  Currently, the explorer runs only with chrome and expects a standalone Selenium Server
    to be running at http://localhost:4444 (see Setting Up the Selenium Server).

  From the Protractor directory, run with:

  $ node ./bin/elementexplorer.js <urL>
    This will load up the URL on WebDriver and put the terminal into a REPL loop.
    You will see a > prompt. The browser, element and protractor variables will be available. Enter a command such as:

  > element(by.id('foobar')).getText()
  or
  > browser.get('http://www.angularjs.org')
  To get a list of functions you can call, try:

  > browser
  Typing tab at a blank prompt will fill in a suggestion for finding elements.
